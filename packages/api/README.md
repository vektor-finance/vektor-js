# Vektor's API client

## OpenAPI

This library is mostly generated using [openapi-generator](https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator).

### Generating the client

We define an `OpenAPI` spec for our endpoints so we can document and generate clients. Please [see here for more details](/backend/README.md#OpenAPI)

To generate an updated client run the following from the `vektor-js` directory:

```bash
./generate_openapi_api_package.sh
```
